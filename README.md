# Space_Invaders
This is a clone project of the game Space Invaders.
With this I intend to use all the knowledge acquired after reading through the chapter "Getting Started" of the "Learn OpenGL" book and practice and further improve my skills with OOP, while also learning more about the C++ language.

In it´s current state, the menu screen has been finished:

If you want to download the .exe file, you can find on "/builds/0_05- menu_showcase", simply download the entire folder and run the .exe file inside of it. It should run as demonstrated on the GIF.

The used keys are:
- UP/Down;
- ESC: Close application.

The text rendering was made using CBFG, and his example code, although with some changes.

Aside from the learOpenGL website, i´ve also used the OpenGL series from the Cherno´s youtube channel:
