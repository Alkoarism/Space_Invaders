# Space_Invaders
This is a clone project of the game Space Invaders.
With this I intend to use all the knowledge acquired after reading through the chapter "Getting Started" of the "Learn OpenGL" book and practice and further improve my skills with OOP, while also learning more about the C++ language.

In itÂ´s current state, there is not mutch done but there is something to be shown. This is the curret state of the project:

If you want to download the .exe file, you can find on "/builds/0_03- text_rendering_demo", download it as well as the "res" folder, put both on the same folder and it should run like the video.

The used keys are:
- WASD: Wander around;
- 0, 1, 2 and 3: Change the text;
- Mouse: Move the camera;
- ESC: Close application.

The text rendering was made using CBFG, and his example code, although with some changes.
